## Frontier 


The frontier in machine learning is a representation of what a model can achieve and what is still unexplored. 
When an algorithm performs well on a particular task or dataset, 
the frontier lies where there is room for improvements, whether it's through adjusting the model architecture, 
optimizing hyperparameters, or expanding the training dataset.

Exploring the frontier in machine learning is an ongoing process where researchers and practitioners strive to improve algorithm performance,
develop new models, and explore techniques to push the boundaries of what is possible.
